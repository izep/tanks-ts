# History: Spec 011 Re-Verification (2026-02-02 17:48)

## Context
Ralph Loop re-verification mode. All 11 specs marked COMPLETE, randomly selected Spec 011 (MIRV Mechanics) for quality check.

## Verification Results
✅ **All acceptance criteria passed:**
- MIRV deploys exactly 5 warheads at apogee (verified in code & tests)
- Even spread with offsets: -100, -50, 0, 50, 100
- Split only when vy > 0 (descending past apogee)
- Fizzles on early terrain hit (clearance check prevents split)
- Each warhead is a missile (correct weaponType)
- Comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
- Build succeeds with no errors

## Code Review
- `src/systems/physics/WeaponBehavior.ts` lines 27-52: Clean implementation
- `tests/mirv.test.ts`: 4 tests covering all edge cases
- No regressions found

## Lessons
- Re-verification confirms implementation quality is solid
- Test coverage is thorough and catches edge cases
- MIRV mechanics working as specified

## Status
✅ Spec 011 verified complete and correct. No fixes needed.
