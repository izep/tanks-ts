# Spec 010 Re-Verification - 2026-02-03 00:43

## Task
Ralph loop re-verification of completed Spec 010: Implement Economy System

## Verification Results
**Status: ✅ ALL CRITERIA PASS**

### Verified:
1. ✅ EconomySystem.ts exists at src/systems/EconomySystem.ts
2. ✅ MarketState interface with all required fields (basePrices, currentPrices, purchaseCount, salesCount, volatility)
3. ✅ updatePrice() increases price on purchase (lines 40-43)
4. ✅ updatePrice() decreases price on sale (lines 44-48)
5. ✅ Prices clamped to 50%-200% of base (lines 51-55)
6. ✅ Volatility affects price change rate (none: 0%, low: 5%, medium: 10%, high: 20%)
7. ✅ applyMarketForces() drifts prices 2% toward base per call (lines 67-74)
8. ✅ Full integration with ShopSystem (getPrice, updatePrice called on purchases)
9. ✅ 11 economy tests pass (tests/economy.test.ts)
10. ✅ Tests verify price fluctuations and bounds
11. ✅ Build succeeds (218ms)

### Key Implementation Details:
- Price increase: `currentPrice *= (1 + volatilityMultiplier)`
- Price decrease: `currentPrice *= (1 - volatilityMultiplier * 0.5)`
- Market drift: `currentPrice += (basePrice - currentPrice) * 0.02`
- Rounding: All prices rounded to integers
- ShopSystem integration: Uses economySystem.getPrice() and calls updatePrice() on transactions

## Test Coverage
All 11 economy tests pass:
- Initialization with base prices
- Volatility level support
- Price increase on purchase
- Price decrease on sale
- Price clamping (50%-200%)
- Different volatility rates
- Market forces drift
- Purchase/sales count tracking
- Price rounding

## Outcome
Spec 010 is complete, fully functional, and well-tested. No regressions found.
