# 2026-02-03 Spec Verification

## What was learned
- All specs in specs/ are marked COMPLETE and have all acceptance criteria checked off.
- Weapon implementation matches spec for costs and bundle sizes, but blast radii are significantly larger than specified in Requirements.md Section 2.1.
- Most major systems from the TODO.md plan are present, but high-level features (AI personalities, config, teams, audio, save/load) are missing or incomplete.

## Decisions
- No further spec work needed until new specs are added or existing ones are updated.
- Recommend future specs to address blast radius discrepancies and missing systems for full compliance.
