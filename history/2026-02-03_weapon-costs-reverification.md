# 2026-02-03 Weapon Costs Re-Verification

## What was learned
- All weapon cost specs (013-016) are correctly implemented in WeaponData.ts, tests, and shop system.
- No regressions found; prices are synchronized across all systems.
- Automated tests and build provide strong guarantees of correctness.

## Decisions
- No changes needed; all specs remain marked COMPLETE.
- Continue periodic re-verification to maintain integrity.
