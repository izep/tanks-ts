Instructions for using the .mtn (Mountain) builder program.
************************************************************

This .mtn builder program may be run from the CD or may be copied
to a hard drive for running. 

The .bmp files being converted to .mtn files must be stored
on writeable media (hard disk, floppy, etc)

In Windows use Explorer or My computer to locate the
Mountain folder on the CD then double click on Mountain.exe.

A Shortcut may be created and stored in the .bmp folder if you
do not want to go to the Mountain.exe folder to start the program. 

The program will prompted you to input the name of the .bmp 
file being converted to a .mtn file.

When your are running the program for the CD, the file 
name of the .bmp file must include the full path
to the file since it can not be on the CD in the same
folder as the Mountain.exe file.

Only the name of .bmp folder needs to be entered if the 
Mountain.exe file you are using is in the same folder
as the .bmp file being converted.

In DOS go to the Mountain directory then type Mountain to
start the program. You will then be prompted to input the name 
of the .bmp file being converted to a .mtn file.

The new .mtn file will be written to the same folder as
the original .bmp file.

Check the message window to see that the program ran correctly and
then close the program window.
